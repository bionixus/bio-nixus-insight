  "bodyHtml": "<h2 id=\"landscape\">The Modernization of European Infrastructure</h2><p>As we navigate 2026, European hospitals are undergoing a massive digital overhaul. <strong>Hospital market research</strong> now centers on the transition from 'product-selling' to 'solution-selling.' With the German Hospital Future Act (KHZG) nearing its final implementation phases, the focus has shifted from hardware to interoperable software ecosystems.</p><h2 id=\"procurement\">The Shift in Procurement Authority</h2><p>Centralized procurement is no longer just about price. Clinical decision-making units (CDMUs) are now prioritizing total cost of ownership (TCO) and long-term patient outcomes. Market research indicates that in 70% of German and French hospitals, procurement leads now have a seat at the clinical board, meaning medical value must be translated into economic efficiency. Effective <strong>hospital market research</strong> must map these complex stakeholder hierarchies.</p><h2 id=\"value-based\">Value-Based Healthcare (VBHC) Implementation</h2><p>Hospitals are increasingly adopting VBHC models to manage tightening budgets. This requires manufacturers to provide data that proves their device or drug reduces hospital stay duration or prevents readmission. Our data shows that 45% of hospitals in Northern Europe have implemented some form of outcome-based payment by early 2026. Research must therefore focus on the specific KPIs that hospital administrators use to measure 'value.'</p><h2 id=\"conclusion\">Summary</h2><p>To succeed, firms must look beyond the Chief of Surgery and engage with the Chief Information Officer and the Procurement Director. The future of hospital sales is data-driven and outcome-oriented.</p>",
