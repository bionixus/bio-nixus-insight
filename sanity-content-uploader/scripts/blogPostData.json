  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "How long does healthcare market research typically take in UAE?",
      "answer": "Comprehensive pharmaceutical market research in UAE typically requires 8-12 weeks from project initiation to final deliverables. This timeline includes: 2-3 weeks for research design and IRB approvals, 4-6 weeks for primary data collection (physician interviews/surveys), and 2-3 weeks for analysis and reporting. Expedited timelines of 6-8 weeks are possible for focused studies with limited sample sizes, while complex multi-stakeholder research may extend to 14-16 weeks."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are typical costs for pharmaceutical market research in UAE?",
      "answer": "Project costs vary based on scope, methodology, and sample size. Typical ranges include: Physician quantitative surveys (n=50-80): $15,000-25,000; Qualitative physician interviews (n=12-15): $12,000-20,000; KOL mapping and identification: $8,000-15,000; Comprehensive market landscape including quantitative, qualitative, and KOL components: $30,000-50,000. Advisory boards with 8-12 participants: $25,000-40,000. Costs include physician honoraria, IRB fees, data collection, analysis, and reporting."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need separate regulatory approval for market research in different UAE emirates?",
      "answer": "Regulatory requirements vary by healthcare setting. Federal MOHAP hospitals require central IRB approval. Dubai Health Authority (DHA) facilities require DHA-specific ethics approval. Abu Dhabi Department of Health (DOH) facilities follow DOH protocols. Private hospitals typically require approval from facility-level ethics committees or department heads. A skilled research partner with established relationships can navigate these parallel approval processes efficiently, often securing approvals across multiple jurisdictions simultaneously."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should market research be conducted in Arabic or English in UAE?",
      "answer": "Bilingual capabilities provide optimal results. While English serves as the medical lingua franca in UAE, our research shows 62% of Arab physicians prefer Arabic for nuanced clinical discussions. Offering physicians the choice of interview language generates richer insights, particularly regarding patient communication challenges, cultural treatment barriers, and practice management issues. Research materials (interview guides, surveys) should be professionally translated with medical terminology validation, not merely literally translated."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does UAE healthcare market research differ from Saudi Arabia or other GCC markets?",
      "answer": "Key differences include: (1) Regulatory environment — UAE operates three parallel systems (MOHAP/DHA/DOH) vs. Saudi's centralized SFDA, (2) Demographics — UAE's expatriate-majority population vs. Saudi's national-majority creates different epidemiological profiles, (3) Payer landscape — UAE's fragmented insurance market vs. Saudi's government-dominated payer system, (4) Physician access — UAE's international physician community vs. Saudi's increasing proportion of Saudi nationals, (5) Language preferences — Higher English proficiency in UAE physician population. These differences necessitate country-specific research approaches rather than one-size-fits-all GCC strategies."
