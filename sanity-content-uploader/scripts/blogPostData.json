  "bodyHtml": "<h1>Abu Dhabi DOH vs. Dubai DHA: The 2026 Formulary Submission Guide for the UAE</h1>\n<p>The UAE is the second-largest pharmaceutical market in the GCC, characterized by rapid adoption of innovative therapies and a sophisticated regulatory environment. However, access is deeply bifurcated between the two major emirates.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"core-infrastructure\">1. The Core Infrastructure</h2>\n<p>Before submission, commercial teams must understand the foundational architecture of both emirates.</p>\n\n<h3>Abu Dhabi: Department of Health (DOH)</h3>\n<p>Highly structured and consolidated. The public network is SEHA (PureHealth), and Malaffi serves as the unified health information exchange.</p>\n\n<h3>Dubai: Dubai Health Authority (DHA)</h3>\n<p>Fragmented and overwhelmingly private-sector driven. Governed by DHA and MOHAP, with the ISAHD insurance framework mandating coverage for all residents.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"submission-criteria\">2. Formulary Submission & Evaluation Criteria</h2>\n<p>The strategic approach differs fundamentally based on the target emirate.</p>\n\n<h3>Winning in Abu Dhabi (DOH & SEHA)</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Health Technology Assessment (HTA):</strong> Rigorous pharmacoeconomic modeling is mandatory. Localization of data to show Abu Dhabi-specific cost-offsets is critical.</li>\n  <li><strong>Localization Advantage:</strong> Price preference and expedited registration for companies localizing manufacturing.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Winning in Dubai (DHA & Private Payers)</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Fragmented Payer Negotiations:</strong> Securing reimbursement requires negotiating with dozens of private insurers and TPAs.</li>\n  <li><strong>Physician Pull-Through:</strong> In Dubai, top specialists at private hospitals drive market access by pushing TPAs for coverage of innovative therapies.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"price-referencing\">3. The Price-Referencing Challenge</h2>\n<p>Both emirates use International Reference Pricing (IRP). A high-priced entry in Dubai that fails Abu Dhabi's strict HTA thresholds can lead to a national price cut that ripples across the entire GCC.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"takeaways\">4. Key Takeaways for 2026 Brand Planning</h2>\n<p>1. Divide commercial operations distinctly between DOH and DHA. 2. Prioritize HEOR evidence for Abu Dhabi. 3. Prioritize KOL and brand-awareness for Dubai's private sector.</p>",

      "question": "What are the main differences between DOH and DHA?",
      "answer": "DOH (Abu Dhabi) is centralized and evidence-driven, requiring strict HTA submissions. DHA (Dubai) is more fragmented, with access gated by private insurance companies and TPA negotiations."
    },
    {
      "question": "How important is Malaffi for market access?",
      "answer": "Extremely. Malaffi provides the epidemiological baseline data needed to validate market sizing and budget impact models during P&T committee negotiations in Abu Dhabi."
