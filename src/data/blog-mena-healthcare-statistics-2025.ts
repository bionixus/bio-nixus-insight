    <h2 id="why-these-stats-matter">Why These Statistics Matter for Market Access</h2>
    <p>For global pharmaceutical and biotech companies, these figures reveal a rapid paradigm shift. Historically, the GCC was viewed primarily as an export market with passive distribution. Today, navigating these surging markets requires deep localization, robust <strong>Key Opinion Leader (KOL) mapping</strong>, and highly tailored <strong>Health Technology Assessment (HTA)</strong> submissions aligned with cost-containment (especially concerning the high prevalence of diabetes and the rapid growth of oncology biologics).</p>
